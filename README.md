Dissipative Hamiltonian Mechanics
This repository contains the numerical simulations for my honours thesis on "Non-conservative Hamiltonian Mechanics and its Applications" at Physics department at UBC. 

The main goal of my project is to develop mathematical tools to describe the dissipation in non-conservative systems (for example. loss in momentum, energy) using double coordinate Hamiltonian mechanics. This repository includes numerical simulation results that validate my theoretical models with examples like the damped harmonic oscillator and a falling ball with drag.
